BlockCanvas Changelog ...... 

Added features:

 - Groups/Loops support
   The app is now capable to manage loop/group of different form. The abstraction introduced 
   by FunctionCallGroup object together with GroupSpec object should be enough general to 
   represent every type of code block admissible in Python (a small effort is needed to add
   support for multi-block construct like if....else, try...except etc.). 

   Plain group have been added due to its consistency with the existence in the work-flow of
   group of statements that all together describe a "functionality" like "hardware_interface',
   'pre-processing', 'denoising' etc. It is not just a "view" problem to put them together, think  
   for example about the opportunity to reuse the same "block" in different application. 
   This "migration" will be fully supported when an export methods will be added to FunctionCallGroup obj.

Bug Fix:

 - Load/Save Project
   It has been fixed and also manage group creation parsing code. 
   
 - Save script

Optimization:

 - Context cleaned before executing the code. Results that are just to be overwritten are cleaned 
   from the context passed to exec. It speeds up the execution of a factor that increase with increasing 
   size of this old-results. Working with ndarray of about 3e5 elements it speedup the code of about 15 times
   on my machine. 

 - No execution adding block. 

Experimental features:

 - Put together Code&Data to create e self-contained Script/Function to use for batch application. 

 
Future Targets:

 - Export of plain group.

 - Properly restore Projects containing Plain group. 

 - Fully support group/loop creation (e.g. adding every possible form of for, while loop as well as all the other 
                                construct like if....elif....else etc.).  

 - Graphically manage group/loop creation through some visual aids (e.g. like mouse_selection of different blocks then
   pressing a button).  

Dreams: 

 - Create a Python (full) Graphical Programming Environment.
 

	  
Small chenge to understand how to work with the new branch "dev" ....
