    """ This class holds style settings for rendering an EnableBox on the canvas.

        I don't think this is the way styles should be implemented really.
        It seems that there should be some attempt to match string names that
        are looked up. instead of this hard coded naming approach.  This isn't
        my area, but something like CSS seems like it would be better.  I'll
        leave this to some other style guru.

        So, this class exists to make it easy to play with different rendering
        styles of function boxes and switch the entire set out on the fly.
