Project Persistance
--------------------

Saving a project:
-----------------
    General:
    --------
    * Project is saved in the user-directory; and the key is the project-name.
        <user-directory> : ETSConfig.user_data
                            C:\\Documents and Settings\\John Doe\\Enthought or
                            /home/JohnDoe/Enthought

    * Project is saved in 2 phases:
        Project file: <user-directory>/<project-name>.prj
        Project directory: <user-directory>/<project-name>_files
                            should contain the following:
                            1. <project_name>.pickle  : Context
                            2. <project_name>.py      : Script
                            3. OPTIONALLY, .txt files storing the interactor-ranges:
                                a. <project_name>_shadow_interactor_range_file.txt
                                    File-format:
                                    ------------
                                    Each line contains 3 entries :
                                    a string, and 2 floats
                                    eg: a <low_of_a> <high_of_a>

                                b. <project_name>_parametric_interactor_range_file.txt
                                    File-format:
                                    ------------
                                    Each line contains 4 entries :
                                    a string, and 3 floats
                                    eg: a <low_of_a> <high_of_a> <step_of_a>
                                c. **Stochastic ranges persistance yet to be done **


    Different use-cases:
    --------------------
    * Save a project afresh (MenuAction: Save Project As)
    * Save a project back where it was loaded from (MenuAction: Save Project)

    Comments:
    ---------------
    * The range-preferences get saved automatically every time the UI for the
      configurable-interactor is closed. Is this desirable ?
    * The user should be able to edit the script and the interactor range-files.


Loading a project:
------------------
    General:
    --------
    * Project should be loaded using the .prj file
    * It should load the following:
        1. Context
        2. Script (and hence the block)
        3. If present, the interactor range-files


Loading interactor-range preferences:
-------------------------------------
Interactor range-preferences can be loaded from 3 different locations:
1. Units DB: units_ranges.txt
2. Users' global preferences: Should be a file in the Application-Data or
                                User/ directory
                                * should be a .txt file
                                * user should be able to edit it
                                * should contain lines of ranges in the format
                                  of a variable-name and 2 or 3 floats
                                  <name> <low> <high> <step>
                                  ** low, high will be used for shadow interactors
                                  ** low, high, step will be used for parametric
                                     interactors.
                                * This is assuming, values for the Imperial unit
                                  system, if applicable.
3. Project preferences: This will be whatever is set during the project session,
                        as explained, in 'Saving a Project'

    Comments
    --------
    The precedence for ranges will be: Units < Global < Project


TODO:
-----
1. When opening a new project, prompt the user to save the current project.
2. Setup for users to save out global preferences for interactor ranges.
3. Set the project preferences for a global-preferences file for interactor ranges.
4. Add support for saving out preferences for other interactors apart from
   shadow and parametric.
