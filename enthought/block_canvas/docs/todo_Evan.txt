Function Search
================

Features
--------
 * Need a way to specify a PYTHONPATH through the prefs dialogue
   [DONE]
 * Sort function list by either python_path or name. Currently only sorts by
   name. How does the TabularEditor allow sorting? Or does it have to be done
   manually?
   [DONE]
 * Creating a new function needs to save it in a predefined path
   [DONE]
   FIXME: Allow specifying this path is prefs dialogue instead of using
          AppDataLocator.
 * Creating a new function should be done without a huge button at the top of
   the view. Perhaps make a 'Create new function' item that is always at
   the top of functions list.
   [DONE]
 * User defined functions should be able to be deleted/modified. Use a right-
   click context menu?

Bugs
----
 * The function prefs takes forever to startup because it is firing numerous
   _modules_changed events. Why it is doing this is unclear to me.
   [FIXED]
