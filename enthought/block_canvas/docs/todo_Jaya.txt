Feature: Adding new function:
-----------------------------

DONE 1.  [TESTING] Unit tests for NewFunctionCall
2.  [FEATURE] Save preferences for path for saving functions
3.  [REFACTOR/low] Should be an entry in the list of packages at the top 
    instead of a button
4.  [FEATURE] Double-click on a function to add it to canvas
        -should be handled by ISelectionContainerController/SelectionManager
5.  [REFACTOR/low] Move the add-function-button from the search-interface to 
        the main-interface ?
6.


Function-Search:
----------------
1.  [TESTING] Write more unit-tests on the packages populated by the    
        search function.
        Resolved a case where it was walking into a class, and retrieving class
        methods. Should check rigorously for such exceptions.
2.  [BUG] The green arrow button takes a long time to work. 
3.  [BUG] I added 'geophysics' in the modules column: it doesn't seem to    
            populate any of the cp.geophysics methods. 
4.  [FEATURE] Should be able to sort by packages. Currently it is sorted by name 
            only.
DONE 5.  [BUG] If there is no __init__.py file, the drag and drop fails as the 
            function cannot be imported. In such a case, it should not be 
            present in the function-list.
6.


Blocks:
-------
1.  [TESTING] Error checking for block execution.
        *   Drag function 'biotc' to the graph view when running main.py, it 
            throws a NameError. seems like there should be a check if all the 
            input parameters have mappings in the context before the block 
            executes.
        *


Graph-view:
-----------
1.  [BUG] Fix Cancel function on FunctionBox
2.  


Function-Call:
--------------
DONE 1.  [TESTING] Unit tests for UnittedFunctionCall
2.

Bug-report from testing the app:
-----------------------------
1.  Data resource-tree gives AttributeError on clicking on any variable.
2.  Resource-tree allows renames, which should be updated in the code and   
    variables list.
3.  Loading empty file at the 'File' tab gives an IOError.
4.

General from code-browsing:
---------------------------
    [Look-out for FIXME's and clean up most of the code]
    [Start reorganizing code to different sub-packages]
    [Put in tickets on Traits2.1 (on event-handling etc.) to Dave M.]
