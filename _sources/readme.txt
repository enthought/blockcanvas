Application Overview
---------------------


This application is intended to explore ideas for visually edit/run/debug
data flow networks and explore the data generated by them.

Users can see two (partially) synchronized views of the data flow.  One is the
actual python code that represents the data flow, and the other is a visual
layout of the data flow on a canvas.  The canvas is fairly simple in that it
doesn't show all the input/output ports of functions -- it simply draws a single
line between two related functions.  This is a valuable view, but we will likely
want to enhance it with a "port" view later.  Users can move components around
on the graph.  They can select multiple items with Ctrl-click, and they can move
multiple items as a group.  They can also delete functions with the "Del" key.
(The "close" icon in the corner of functions should also delete components, but
buttons are working right now.)

If you edit the code view, the canvas will update (and through out any layout
you may have done -- bad).  However, editing the workflow on the canvas does not
synchronize to the code view -- bad.  Figuring out the correct underlying model
for this is a major future task for us.

There are two additional widgets in the view.  One is a search window that
allows you to search through a list of functions.  You can drag/drop functions
from this window onto the canvas and that component is added.  It names the
inputs of the function the same name as they are declared in the function.  The
output is generically named "result".  This can be improved if we parse the
function code looking for a return statement.  For our rock physics libraries,
this will work pretty well.  Also, we can do better than this with has_units
functions because their inputs and outputs are available as attributes on the
function.  If you add a function to the canvas, it is not added to the code as
we do not have a code generator from blocks at the moment.  This is not to hard
to write, but it also may not be the desired model... (we'll have to see).

The other widget shows the input/output/functions currently on the function.
It will udpate as the canvas updates.  You can sort by type or name.  In the
future, clicking on one of these should highlight the function blocks on the
canvas that it pertains to.  Also, the code view should indicate the lines
it pertains to.

That is it so far.  I would like to have function input/output editors, and
a context viewer up and running fairly soon.


Architecture
------------

This entire application centers around viewing/editing/debugging a graph
representation of executable Python code and viewing/manipulating the input/
outut data to the graph.  The "executable graph" is currently represented
as a Block from enthought.numerical_modelling.  It is a reasonable start, but
may not suffice for editing graphs [to be determined].  The data part is likely
to be a NumericContext item, but it should probably work (at least for execution
if it is a lowly dictionary).

Our current application generally breaks up into 3 chunks of functionality that
are bound together by the ``Display`` class in ``main.py``.  They are the
1) search widget (``function_search.py``, and ``function_search_ui.py``, 2)
variable display widget (``block_variables_ui.py``), and 3) The canvas which
makes up the bulk of the application code (see below).

The other important class is  the ``BlockGraphController`` which ties the
canvas view to its underlying ``Block`` model.  Users interact with the canvas,
but the controller decides what to do with these individual actions.  It also
updates the view if the block changes underneath it.  This class will likely
need to get inputs from the ``block_variables_ui`` as well to highlight or
"flash" blocks that are highlighted on the canvas.  It will likely want to
control the code window in the future as well.


Canvas Architecture
===================

The basic building blocks for the canvas are the:

========================  ======================================================
Canvas Related Classes    Description
========================  ======================================================
SelectionContainer        This is an enhanced Enable Container that can
                          manage the selection of multiple components within
                          it.  This list of selections is managed by a
                          SelectionManager object.

                          Whenever this container gets events like "delete"
                          or "move", it hands off the actual work to a
                          controller that decides a) what to do with the
                          visualization and b) what to do with the
                          underlying model.  In our case, this is the
                          BlockGraphController.

SelectioManager           Actually, this guy does most of the work for the
                          SelectionContainer.

ISelectable               Interface required by the SelectionManager to deal
                          with "Selectable" items on a canvas.

SelectableComponentMixin  Mixin that handles selecting and moving state
                          tranisitions for items on the canvas.  It
                          handles this aspect for EnableBox.

EnableLine                connection lines between function boxes.  The end
                          points of the lines are connected to an input and
                          an ouput function and the line is redrawn any time
                          one of the function boxes is moved.

EnableImageButton         Button Component that changes button image on
                          role-over and fires a clicked event.  It doesn't
                          yet give visual feedback when clicked.  This is
                          currently only used as the CloseButton in the
                          EnableFunctionBox.

CloseButton               Extends button to anchor it the top right corner
                          of its container.  Also resets the default icon to
                          use the close icons.

EnableBox                 Generic labeled box that participate in selection
                          on a canvas.  Something like this guy should go in
                          a generic object canvas in Enable.

EnableFunctionBox         A specialized version of EnableBox for drawing
                          functions on the canvas.  It also adds the
                          CloseButton to the function.
